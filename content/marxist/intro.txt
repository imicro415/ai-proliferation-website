Artificial Intelligence represents a new terrain through which existing class struggles are being rearticulated. Far from a neutral technological advance, AI proliferation intensifies longstanding capitalist dynamics by reshaping labor relations, concentrating control over production, and expanding the power of both state and corporate actors. From a Marxist and Neo-Gramscian perspective, AI is best understood as a continuation of historical patterns of accumulation rather than a rupture from them.

The development and deployment of AI systems depend on global chains of extraction, data capture, and automation that further alienate workers from their labor while consolidating capital in the hands of those who own and govern these technologies. As AI is integrated into workplaces and institutions, it accelerates labor displacement, reinforces managerial control, and legitimizes existing inequalities. This positions AI not as an emancipatory force, but as a mechanism through which capitalist domination is reproduced.
