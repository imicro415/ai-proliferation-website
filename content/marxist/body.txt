Artificial Intelligence develops within capitalist imperatives that prioritize profit maximization, concentrate power, and reproduce structural inequality. AI is not a neutral technological evolution; its development is overwhelmingly driven by private corporations whose primary obligation is to shareholders rather than workers or the public. This trajectory reflects a broader trend in late-stage capitalism in which technological innovation is subordinated to the singular directive of increasing shareholder value. As Daron Acemoglu observes, contemporary AI deployment is "heavily skewed toward concentrating economic power in the hands of a small group of technology companies," underscoring that the form and direction of AI are shaped by the capitalist profit motives rather than social need.

Legal and institutional frameworks further legitimize this imbalance. In the United States, labor and employment laws ostensibly protect workers, yet in practice they function as guardrails that stabilize capitalist authority rather than challenge it. As Brishen Rogers notes, U.S. labor law grants employers "extraordinary unilateral authority to introduce new technologies... with almost no worker input," enabling AI to be deployed in ways that privilege ownership and management over labor. Rather than restraining exploitation, the legitimacy of these legal structures normalizes it, allowing structural inequality and workplace coercion to persist under the guise of neutrality and rule of law. Similar dynamics appear in the European Union, where the 2024 AI Act frames regulation around "trust, safety, and competitiveness," embedding capital accumulation as a core objective even with rights-based governance. Across both contexts, innovation is protected insofar as it reinforces capitalist imperatives.

Within workplaces, AI function less a complement to labor than as a substitutive and disciplinary force. Corporations deploy AI to reduce labor costs, increase productivity, and intensify managerial control, often at the expense of wages, autonomy, and job security. AI systems deskill workers by removing specialized knowledge from labor process, eroding bargaining power while enabling surveillance and performance monitoring that further disciplines the workforce. This displacement is not merely technological; it is also legal and structural, as institutional arrangements facilitate the transfer of control from workers to management under the banner of efficiency. 

AI proliferation is sustained by a consolidated elite whose economic, managerial and institutional power shapes the conditions under which technology is developed and deployed. Legal frameworks and regulatory regimes confer legitimacy on this authority, allowing AI to operate as a mechanism of domination rather than emancipation. From a Neo-Gramscian perspective, AI is embedded within a hegemonic project that secures elite interests by normalizing technological control, capital concentration, labor subordination. 

The crisis of AI proliferation, therefore, cannot be reduced to geopolitical competition between states or technological races between global powers. It is fundamentally a crisis of class. Mainstream international relations analyses often overlook how AI is weaponized against workers and marginalized populations, despite the fact that these groups bear the brunt of its consequences. AI represents not a break from historical patterns of class struggle, but their intensification. AI provides new tools through which inequality is reproduced and legitimized so long as capitalist hegemony remains intact.
