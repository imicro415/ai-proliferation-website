The theoretical framework of AI proliferation can be viewed from both the realist and liberal lenses. A realist analysis of AI proliferation recognizes AI as a strategic enabler that could reshape global balance of power. Michael C. Horowitz argues that advances in narrow AI applications such as image recognition could confer significant military advantages on states with the capacity to integrate these technologies into their defense systems, potentially shifting distributions among great powers. Because development is done in the private sector, diffusion into military applications may be rapid, but states that fail to quickly integrate these systems would be caught unaware and risk strategic decline. Additionally, the advancement of AI agents to potentially control autonomous ground vehicles such as tanks or transport vehicles cannot be downplayed either. These would shift the military logistical capabilities of those states that integrate AI agents of these kinds quickly enough.

Alternatively, liberal perspectives emphasize the potential for international cooperation and institutional design to manage AI. Talberg et al. argue that global governance of AI is likely to emerge through overlapping regimes rather than a single comprehensive regime, involving states, international organizations, and non-state actors. OECD, UNESCO, and the EU are working to create common ground for how AI should be developed, deployed and governed. They aim to set shared ethical norms, basic legal rules, and coordinated standards so that AI evolves in line with societal values and legal frameworks, rather than each country or company settings its own approach.

Taking into consideration the history of AI proliferation along with considerations of both realist and liberal lenses. I believe this growing crisis is one that should carefully considered using a mixture of multiple lenses. Artificial intelligence has the capability to shift the balance of power in a purely state driven and militarily focused manner, but taking into account that most research and development efforts are driven by the private sector it cannot be ignored that there are a multitude of interested actors and parties that will propel AI forward. To best strategize governance, a liberal perspective is needed and that can be seen by efforts taken by various governing agencies and liberal institutions to take stances on AI governance and drive ethics and normative practices in specific directions. These organizations while inconsequential from a realist perspective have proven to sway and influence private sector efforts in the direction that would best suit our collective interests. In addition, the realist lens to quickly and efficiently integrate AI technologies into strategic military use cases is one that is best not ignored to stay prepared for the inevitable adoption of these sophisticated systems by other states.
