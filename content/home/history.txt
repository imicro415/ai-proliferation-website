Artificial Intelligence is often presented as a recent technological breakthrough, but its origins date back to the mid-twentieth century. The field formally emerged in 1956 at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project, where the term "artifical intelligence" was coined and early research focused on symbolic reasoning, logic, and rule-based problem solving. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, researchers developed systems capable of tasks such as game playing, handwriting recognition, and basic mathematical problem solving. Progress slowed in later decades as limitations in computing power and data led to cycles of intense optimism followed by periods of reduced funding, commonly referred to as "AI winters."

Modern AI began to take shape in the 1990s with a shift toward statistical and data-driven methods, marked by advances in speech recognition and IBM's Deep Blue defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov. In the following decades, the growth of the internet, improvements in computing power, and access to large datasets enabled powerful machine learning systems such as Watson, GoogleNet, and AlphaGo to be developed. The public release of tools such as ChatGPT in 2022 made these developments widely acessible, signaling not a breakthrough technology, but the culmination of decades of research that transformed AI from a specialized academic field into a technology with broad social, political and economic ramifications.
